## Migration Guide Between Phases

### Phase 0 ‚Üí Phase 1
- IR schema will be extended (backward compatible)
- Export functions will be replaced with real implementations
- Additional dependencies (advanced mesh libraries)
- Performance improvements for large files

### Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2
- Constraint solver dependencies
- Extended analysis capabilities
- New MCP tools for constraint checking
- Enhanced CLI commands

## Contributing to Future Phases

Each phase builds incrementally on the previous foundation. The modular architecture established in Phase 0 enables:

- **Independent development** of different components
- **Backward compatibility** across phase transitions
- **Flexible deployment** options (local, cloud, hybrid)
- **Clear boundaries** between deterministic and ML-based features
